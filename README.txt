I claim no license to this, especially not to the images folder that has
all those ichat icons in it.

For the ajax calls, the xmlhttprequest object was overridden, but was not
able to overwrite the readonly property where the data is stored so used
json storage instead.

All the tweets are generated via randomness. They will persist until local
storage is cleared or the tests are run.

Areas that could bw improved on with more time:
1) animations!
2) Store each tweet as a custom class with functions to get ID, etc.
3) support same tweet in two tweet listings (right now prevented due to id use)
4) Add sorting.
